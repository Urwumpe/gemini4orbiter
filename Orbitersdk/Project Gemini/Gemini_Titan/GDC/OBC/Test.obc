# Filename:	Test.obc
# Purpose:	This is Gemini OBC code created solely for the purpose
#		of testing the OBC assembler, yaASM.  I don't claim
#		that the program implemented by this source code has
#		any interesting functionality beyond that.
# Website:	http://www.ibiblo.org/apollo/Gemini.html
# Mod history:	2011-12-15 RSB	Created.
#		2011-12-20 RSB	Fixed SPQ operand.
#		2011-12-23 RSB	Added module numbers to CODE and DATA.
#				Also, added some junk to program 
#				module II.
#
# This code doesn't account for any of the physical constraints of the
# OBC such as the need to avoid certain instructions sequences to prevent
# overheating or the need to periodically refresh delay lines.  It's simply
# a logical test of the assembler, and nothing more than that.  
#
# What the code actually does is to loop endlessly, calling EVENFN on even
# iterations and ODDFN on odd iterations.  The functions EVENFN or ODDFN
# do something (or nothing, depending on my whim), and then return to the
# main loop.  Just for fun, I put the main loop, EVENFN, and ODDFUN in
# different memory sectors.  I've thrown in various random comments and 
# variables/constants that aren't used, as well, just to exercise the 
# assembler and see if the output listing is reasonably aesthetically
# pleasing.
#
# Memory allocation for Program Module 0:
#	Sector 00:	Just enough code and data to jump to sector 17
#			(the residual sector), where the main program
#			resides.
#	Sector 05:	Some code that does nothing much, which the
#			main program HOPs to from time to time, and
#			which is supposed to HOP back to the main
#			program immediately.
#	Sector 07:	Some code that the main program HOPs to 
#			occasionally, which is intended to exercise
#			the entire instruction set of the CPU and
#			then HOP back to the main program.
#	Sector 17:	(The residual sector.)  This is where the
#			main program is stored.  It's just an 
#			endless loop that alternately runs the
#			code in sector 05 and 07.
# Memory allocation for Program Module 1:
#	Sector 07:	A mutated form of the code from sector 07
#			of program module 0, which is functionally
#			identical but word-for-word different. It
#			can be loaded into main memory by the 
#			debugger's ATM command, and is intended to
#			test the ability of the assembler, 
#			emulator, and debugger to deal with loadable
#			program modules.

#        	******** IMPORTANT NOTE ********
# DATA and CODE are operators I invented for the new OBC assembler, yaASM,
# and which don't exist in the original OBC assembler as far as I can
# ascertain.  DATA sets the current pointer for assembling variables 
# and constants, while CODE sets the current pointer for assembling 
# instructions.  The operand is of the form SECTOR-SYLLABLE-WORD for OBC
# (or MODULE-SECTOR-SYLLABLE-WORD for LVDC).  Multiple DATA or CODE
# operators can appear in the file, in order to assemble different
# blocks of source code into different regions of memory. DATA and CODE
# use whatever mode (half-word or normal) that happens to be in effect
# at the moment.  The newly-invented directives HALF and NORM
# can be used to change that mode at any time.

# The following are supposed to be HOP constants.  The bit ordering I'm
# using is actually the exact opposite of what I *think* the documentation
# says it's supposed to be, but basically I don't believe what the 
# documentation says.  HEVENFN, HODDFN, and HLOOP are supposed to point to
# the left-hand symbols EVENFN, ODDFN, and LOOP, respectively, which 
# appear later in the code.  There's a newly-invented directive, HOPC,
# to do this, so as to avoid having manually figure out the addresses of
# the targets and form OCT constants instead.  But I do show what OCT

# CODE

# Recall that we're at address 0-17-2-0000 here (because of the CODE directive
# we used earlier), so this is where the program would start executing if we 
# actually ran it.  The left-hand symbol START isn't referenced, but the
# code looks prettier if it's there.
START		CLA	KZERO		# Get 0 into accumulator
		STO	LOOPCNT		# Save it ... it's our loop counter.
# What our loop is going to do is to HOP using HOP constant
# HEVENFN on even loop counts and HODDFN on odd loop counts.  (The code
# pointed to by HCONST1 and HCONST2 will always end up coming back to LOOP
# so that we can perform the next iteration.)
LOOP		CLA	LOOPCNT		# Get the loop counter.
		ADD	K1		# Increment it.
		STO	LOOPCNT		# Save it back to memory.

# The routines pointed to by HCONST1 and HCONST2 are in memory sectors 05 and
# 07 rather than sector 00 like the code above, so we have to use the CODE

# but we add them just to look pretty.
